# data-privacy-final-project

For my final project in CS3110 (data privacy) I aim to predict the quality of wine from numerous features (fixed_acidity, volatile_acidity,...) using multiple differentially private gradient descent algorithms. I then aim to compare the different gradient descent algorithms and determine the best fit algorithm for this dataset.
